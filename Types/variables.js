//Typescript variable annotation
//Syntax - let variableName : type = value;
var myFavMovie = "Iron Man";
myFavMovie = "Iron Man 2";
myFavMovie = "Iron Man 3";
// myFavMovie = 9;
//we can not assign any other type value to given value as typescript follows strict value assignment
//like for number we can not assign value of string as we can do in javascript
